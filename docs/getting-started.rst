So you now have a brand new installation of PaSSHport, but you don't know what to do nextâ€¦

Example prerequisites
=====================
For this tutorial, we will use the following infos :

1 PaSSHport node
----------------
We'll use a monolithic installation of PaSSHport : passhportd, passhport and passhport-admin are on the same host.

3 users

* John, a linux/unix administrator, who needs to access all linux/unix servers
* Vincent, a network administrator, who needs to access all network appliances
* Alice, a general appliance administrator who needs to access all tier appliances

1 PaSSHport admin
------------------
* Marc, the ISSM, who configures PaSSHport, to control all the access rights

3 types of targets
-------------------
* Linux/Unix servers :
 - 1 web server, Linux, www-server / 10.0.1.24

 - 1 SAN bay, san1 / 10.192.1.10

Configure targets
-----------------
First of all, we'll include the targets into PaSSHport.

Let's connect to your PaSSHport node, and add the linux target :
